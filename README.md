# Photo tagging app

Created in the style of where's wally, with a Pokemon theme.

Users need to click around the image to locate the elements displayed in the header.

Uses a firebase backend to store the correct locations of the hidden elements in the main image, and to maintain a high score table of users sorted by the time it took them to find all elements.
